26s2,"The Financial Post reports in its Saturday edition that Quebec and Alberta are leveraging their respective strengths to emerge as hydrogen hubs. The Post's Quinten Casey writes that Hydro-Quebec is aiming to position its home province as the ideal location to produce so-called ""green"" hydrogen, capitalizing on its abundant hydroelectricity. Meanwhile, Alberta unveiled its natural gas vision and ambitions in October, which identified the export of ""blue"" hydrogen products as one of the key planks of its diversification strategy. While hydrogen is emissions-free, the process of producing the element is often not clean. Using electrolysis technology, water is split into hydrogen and oxygen, which requires massive amounts of electricity. ""Green"" hydrogen is produced by running an electric current through water using zero-carbon sources of electricity, such as hydro. This is where Hydro-Quebec sees an obvious edge. On Dec. 8, Hydro-Quebec announced plans to build and operate an electrolysis plant in a suburb of Montreal. The utility says it will be one of the world's most powerful electrolyzers for making green hydrogen, with a capacity of 88 megawatts.
